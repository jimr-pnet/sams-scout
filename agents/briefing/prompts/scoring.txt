**7-8 — Strongly relevant:**
Strategic analysis of how AI will reshape marketing or discovery. Major AI product launches with clear commerce/marketing implications. Data on shifting consumer search behaviour. Agency transformation stories.

**5-6 — Moderately relevant:**
General AI industry news with indirect marketing implications. New AI startups in adjacent spaces. Platform updates (Meta, Amazon) that touch on AI discovery. Broader agentic AI developments that could eventually affect commerce.

**3-4 — Tangentially relevant:**
General tech industry news. AI developments in unrelated verticals but with transferable insights. Marketing industry news without an AI angle.

**1-2 — Low relevance:**
Pure technical AI research. Non-marketing AI applications. General business news.

**0 — Not relevant:**
Completely unrelated to AI, marketing, commerce, or search.
